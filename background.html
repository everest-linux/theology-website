	<p>Confession is one of the most important sacraments that Catholics should</p>
	<p>recieve on a regular basis. Technically, you are only obligated to</p>
	<p>confess your sins once a year, however one should go at least once a month.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Confession is important because it wipes all sin off of your soul and</p>
	<p>reconciles you with God. When the priest says the words of absolution,</p>
	<p>God removes all sins from your soul. This includes mortal and venial sins</p>
	<p>alike.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Steps to making a good confession:</p>
	<strong>Before confession:</strong>
	<p>- Examination of conscience</p>
	<p>- Sorrow for sins</p>
	<p>- Intent to change</p>
	<strong>During confession:</strong>
	<p>- Confession of sins</p>
	<p>- Act of contrition</p>
	<p>- Absolution of sin</p>
	<strong>After confession:</strong>
	<p>- Penance</p>
	<p>3 benefits of confession:</p>
	<p>- Forgives all confessed sins (those not intentionally omitted)</p>
	<p>- Helps us not to commit those sins in the future</p>
	<p>- Renews baptism (the soul of the penitent is as pure as it was during baptism</p>
